Project Title: Tourist Informatics 

Tools used:

*Python as the programming programming language
*Streamlit for interactive web dashboard
*Pandas for handling data filtering and analysis
*Matplotlib for data visualization (pie and bar charts)
*openpyxl for reading Excel files
*VS Code as the code editor

Functionalities:

This dashboard helps analyzing tourist data after the user uploads an excel or csv file with necessary columns. We can use it to:

- Upload a CSV or Excel file from your computer  
- See a filtered list of tourists based on country and destination  
- View summary statistics like average duration of stay and average tourist rating  
- See a bar chart showing how many tourists gave each rating (from 1 to 5)
- See a pie chart showing distribution of tourists by destination
- Download the filtered data as CSV directly from the dashboard

How it works:
   * You start by uploading a CSV or Excel file that contains tourist data.
   * The dashboard waits until you upload a file â€” nothing shows by default.
   * It checks that your file has all the required columns:  
     `Name`, `Country`, `Destination`, `Duration`, `Rating`
   * Once uploaded, you can select:
     - A specific country (e.g., USA)
     - A specific destination (e.g., Cox's Bazar)
   * It calculates and displays:
     - Average duration of stay (how many days tourists stayed)
     - Average rating (tourist satisfaction out of 5)
   * It draws two different charts:
     - A bar chart showing how many tourists gave each rating
     - A pie chart showing how tourists are distributed across destinations
   * It provides a download button to save the filtered data as a CSV file for further use.
